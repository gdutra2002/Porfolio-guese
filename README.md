# Portfolio-guese

## Description:  
* Welcome to my professional full stack portfolio. You will find an overview of my style and work sample in the links to various projects I have developed. Some of them may be team projects done thru my coding bootcamp cohort, others are personal endeavors to explore my interest in coding.
* To showcase who I am as an individual with a unique and complementary style of full stack abilities. I have an open mind, creative personality, like routines as much as exploring, and most importantly plain getting code to work.
* I value others who have different skills and styles than my own, complementary to sum it in a word; I am a team player who enjoys team work and accomplishing a common goal. My interests vary, and I am always open to learn new things.
* This portfolio is a simple one page app built upon the react platform, deployed on github, with my contact information found below on the readme.
